# Quick Lookup :: Graph Viewer :: Remake / Refactoring

## App Description
This is a small plugin for Excel that displays information available in Quick Lookup.

The plugin can be run without Excel (but then some important functionality is not tested) </br>
The panel is displayed in Excel in an Iframe (See setup-video). </br>
It displays information from a simple REST API.

The panel was a part of a proof-of-concept project but now we need to start proper development of it.

# Project Phases

## Phase 0
* Get everything running
* Assess the project
* Report an estimated time for the complete refactoring outlined in Phase 1
  * Look does NOT have to be pixel perfect with Figma version  
* **IMPORTANT** - Wait for an approval before continuing to Phase1

## Phase 1
* Refactor the project
* Make sure everything is functionally on par with this POC version
* Make sure to report full progress after 20 hours and commit everything you have at that time.
  * We decide on next-steps if the task is not completed at that time.
* **IMPORTANT** - Wait for an approval before continuing to Phase2

## Phase 2 :: A follow-up/optional project
* Make minor UI improvements 
  * A list of improvements will be made available once phase 1 is successfully completed
  * **IMPORTANT** - This part is estimated and timed separately at a later stage
  * The 2nd Phase will be done on hourly bases, without requiering an estimate

## You will be rated on:
* The quality and design of the refactored application
* Total time spent
* How well you follow instructions
* How you report progress  
* The over-all quality of communications during the project
